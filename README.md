# RODE Language Specification

**RODE** (Rust-Node Derived Environment) is a hybrid programming language combining the safety and performance of Rust with the dynamic and expressive nature of JavaScript/Node.js. This repository contains the complete specification of the RODE language.

## Introduction

RODE is tailored for developers seeking system-level precision along with high-level scripting capabilities. The language aims to provide a robust, flexible, and efficient environment for modern software development.

## Specification

The detailed specification of RODE is available in the [specification.md](./specification.md) file. It includes comprehensive sections on:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of RODE.
2. **Data Types**: Description of primitive and composite data types.
3. **Variables and Binding**: Rules for variable declaration, binding, and scope.
4. **Control Flow**: Constructs for conditional statements and loops.
5. **Functions**: Function definition, parameters, return types, and higher-order functions.
6. **Memory Management**: Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and garbage collection.
7. **Async Programming**: Asynchronous functions, event loop, concurrency patterns.
8. **Error Handling**: Error types, propagation, custom errors, and backtraces.
9. **Modules and Packages**: Module system, package management, dependencies, and versioning.
10. **Standard Library**: Core libraries for data types, file system, networking, concurrency, math, and more.
11. **Interoperability**: FFI, platform interactions, serialization, plugin system.
12. **Comments and Documentation**: Traditional comments, documentation comments, and the unique comment engine.
13. **Tooling**: Compiler, interpreter, package manager, IDE support, debugging tools, testing framework, profiling tools, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with RODE, clone the repository and explore the specification:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RODE-Language-Specification.git
cd RODE-Language-Specification

Usage
Here's a simple example of a RODE program that prints "Hello, RODE!" to the console:

#context(scripting)

fn main() {
    let message: String = "Hello, RODE!";
    print(message);
}

main();

To run this program, you would use the RODE interpreter (rodei):
rodei hello.rode
